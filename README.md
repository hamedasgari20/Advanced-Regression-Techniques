# House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques in Kaggle

![](./kaggle.png)

This repository contains a comprehensive solution to the Kaggle House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques competition. The goal of the competition is to predict the final price of each home in Ames, Iowa, using advanced regression techniques.

## Project Overview

- **Objective:** Develop a machine learning model to predict house prices based on various features.
- **Dataset:** The dataset includes 79 explanatory variables describing almost every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa.
- **Evaluation Metric:** Root Mean Squared Log Error (RMSLE) between the predicted and actual sale prices.

## Repository Contents
- **main.py:** The main Python script containing data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.
- **submission.csv:** The output file ready for submission to Kaggle.
- **README.md:** This file, providing an overview and instructions for the project.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

```angular2html
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Project Structure
Project Structure
The project follows these main steps:

**1- Data Loading:** Read the training and test datasets.

**2- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** (Optional) Analyze data distributions and relationships.

**3- Data Preprocessing:**
- Handle missing values.
- Encode categorical variables.
- Feature engineering.

**4- Model Building and Evaluation:**
- Split data into training and validation sets.
- Train multiple regression models.
- Evaluate models using RMSLE.

**5- Hyperparameter Tuning:** Use Grid Search to find the best model parameters.

**6- Model Retraining:** Retrain the best model on the entire training dataset.

**7- Prediction:** Predict on the test dataset. 

**8- Submission:** Prepare and save the submission file.
## Running the Script

Run the Script:

```angular2html
python main.py

```
The script will output evaluation metrics and save `submission.csv`, which is ready for submission to Kaggle.
It will also generate plots for residual analysis (optional).

## Results

After running the script and submitting `submission.csv` to Kaggle, you can view your score and ranking on the competition leaderboard.
